GlassNetInfo
============

"OK Glass", "Show network info"


This a simple Glassware that displays the connection status of Glass:
- shows the WiFi IP address
- shows the SSID
- shows the external IP address
- shows the external IP provider name

This info can be manually refreshed.

There is also the possibility to toggle the WiFi.

Every menu is voice-enabled, making this application totally hands-free.

Developped and tested on XE22.
